# Human-Robot Interaction with Hand Gestures
This repository contains code for the development of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designs and their optimisation techniques. This is part of my third-year dissertation, which focuses on accurately controlling robots through hand gesture recognition as an alternative means of communication.


## Overview
The code has been developed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Notebooks in Python as a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used to conduct this research can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roobansappani/hand-gesture-recognition).
