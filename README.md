# Human-Robot Interaction with Hand Gestures
This repository contains code for the development of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designs and their optimisation techniques. This is part of my third-year dissertation, which focuses on creating a model that can accurately control robots through hand gesture recognition as an alternative means of communication.




## Overview
The CNN models were developed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Notebooks in Python as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/athapa11/handgesture-CNN/blob/main/model_dev.ipynb). The dataset used to conduct this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roobansappani/hand-gesture-recognition). A final saved model is then utilised in a Python script that performs real-time hand gesture classification using a webcam for video capture and processing.
